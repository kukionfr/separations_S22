## Writing MarkDown text file

- Markdown is used in describing your code in plain English.
- You can use it between your lines of code, or create a whole dedicated file like this one.
- Each project should contain a **README.md** file to describe the purpose of the project and how to use the code.
- For syntax, refer to the cheat sheet: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
